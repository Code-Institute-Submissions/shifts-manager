### Project goals
The main purpose in the real world for which I designed this application was to provide the employer I currently work with an easy-to-understand and used tool for generating work shifts, thus replacing the use of excel for this.

### Audience goals
* to have at hand a versatile tool for generating working shifts;
* to be able to manipulate the data with which the employer works, the number of working shifts, the number and data of the employees, to edit and delete working shifts and employees;
* to be able to use the application on any device, at the desk of a desktop or laptop and on the move from the tablet or mobile;

### Website owner goals
As I mentioned above the main purpose in the real world for which I designed this application was to provide the employer I currently work with an easy-to-understand and used tool for generating work shifts, thus replacing the use of excel for this. In addition, I intend to develop this application to bring much more functionality, to make it more complex, features that I will detail below. At the same time, this application can be transformed into a product that may in the future be marketed on the profile market.

### Strategy
This project is intended to be an application that facilitates the work of the managers to organize monthly working shifts, an activity that in a company with several hundred employees, can mean an important consumption of time, while it can be used for the main purpose. of the company, that of making a profit. This first version is a primary one that brings only a few functionalities and would be addressed to small companies.

In the future I will add many more features so that the application is an answer to the potential questions of an entrepreneur: how can I not waste time with organizing work shifts?, how can I automatically send to each employee his or her own graph with working shifts? how can I automatically calculate the hours worked by each employee? How can I automatically calculate gross income for each employee?

### Scope
How does this project answer some of the questions above? By implementing several primary functionalities such as employee records and the possibility of editing their data, and most importantly, generating the monthly schedule of working shifts.

### Structure
This first version of the application contains two main functionalities, the first generation and the working shift management and the second one the employee management. In the first part the user can edit a work shift, delete an entire work shift or just one employee from the work shift. In the second functionality, the user can enter a new employee into the database, can edit the employee's data or can even delete it entirely.

### Skeleton
The application was structured in two main components, the first working shifts and the second the management of the employees. There is also a page for editing a working shift that in the future will function as a modal window, without the stand-alone page. Also, adding a new employee as well as editing their data, works as a modal window.
